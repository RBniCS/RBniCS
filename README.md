The **RBniCS** Project contains an implementation in **FEniCS** of several reduced order modelling techniques for parametrized problems.

**RBniCS** is currently developed and maintained at [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/) by [Dr. Francesco Ballarin](https://www.francescoballarin.it) in collaboration with [Prof. Gianluigi Rozza](https://people.sissa.it/~grozza/)'s group at [SISSA mathLab](http://mathlab.sissa.it/). The financial support of the [AROMA-CFD ERC CoG project](https://people.sissa.it/~grozza/aroma-cfd/) is gratefully acknowledged.

Like all core **FEniCS** components, **RBniCS** is freely available under the GNU LGPL, version 3.
